# CCNA Networking Portfolio (Notes + Lab Evidence)

This repository documents my CCNA self-study through:
- **Notes** (written in my own words, based on my handwritten notebook)
- **Labs** (Packet Tracer practice labs documented with configs + verification outputs)

## What you’ll find
- `notes/` → concept summaries + quick checklists + verification commands
- `labs/` → evidence-first lab write-ups with:
  - `evidence/configs/` (device running-config)
  - `evidence/outputs/` (show commands / verification)

## How to use this repo (fast)
1) Start with the topic in `INDEX.md`
2) Read the note file for the concept
3) Open the related lab folder to see evidence and verification

## Lab file policy (important)
I used Packet Tracer lab files from **Jeremy’s IT Lab** during study.
To avoid redistributing third-party materials, I **do not upload `.pkt` files** publicly.
Instead, I share my own documentation: configs, outputs, and write-ups.

## Suggested showcase labs 
- VLAN & Trunking
- STP / RSTP
- EtherChannel
- DHCP
